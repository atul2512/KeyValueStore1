# KeyValueStore

This is a project for COEN 317 - Distributed Computing course at SCU.

Implementing a distributed Key Value Store similar to Cassandra. The milestones for the project are:

*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">Using Chord algorithm to implement a distributed hash table.</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">Achieve 2 level replication</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">The end application is for uses to store the metadata about the songs like album name, artist and file &nbsp;location.&nbsp;</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">This is stored in our distributed key‐value store and allow another user (node) to search &nbsp;for the same file even when the original uploader is offline. This makes for a high available and a &nbsp;fault‐tolerant key‐value store. &nbsp;</span>
